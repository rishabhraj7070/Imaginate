🌟 Imaginate – Story Generator Website
📖 About the Project

Imaginate is a simple and creative Story Generator Website where users can enter their own ideas and explore demo story outputs.
This project is designed for hackathons, demos, and learning purposes.

Currently, it showcases Indian Army–themed stories (200 words each, written in easy language) with images, without using any API integration.
In future updates, Imaginate can connect to AI APIs (like Gemini) to create unique, personalized stories in real time.
